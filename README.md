> This repository holds some programs that will calculate certain values which can't already be done via standard TI calculators

### Version notes
  Some programs may use commands like ``toString()`` which are not available on version of the OS earlier than 5.2
  To check your OS version view [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIN1ESNRMfc).
  If you have an earlier version I would advise simply removing the use of this command and only leaving any referenced variables.
  If you still have issues after doing so I'd be happy to take a look and either help fix the error or upload a new version which don't utilize these commands.
