> This repository holds some programs that will calculate certain values which can't already be done via standard TI calculators

### Version notes
  Some programs may use commands like ``toString()`` which are not available on version of the OS earlier than 5.2
  To check your OS version view [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIN1ESNRMfc).
  If you have an earlier version I would advise simply removing the use of this command and only leaving any referenced variables.
  If you still have issues after doing so I'd be happy to take a look and either help fix the error or upload a new version which don't utilize these commands.

  
### Naming conventions
  Putting descriptive names into such a small space was a bit of a challenge so often a letter will stand for something that will be indicative of the 
  programs function. I've established the common ones bellow to avoid confusion (I'll update this as programs are added as well):
    - "PZT": Prop Z Test
    - "ZT": Z Test
